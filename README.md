# Car Dealership Website
## Overview

Welcome to the Car Dealership Website repository, the result of the Web Programming course assignment. The objective of this project was to implement a fully functional car dealership website using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, adopting a data structure-first approach with the .NET framework, and incorporating user authentication with Identity. The assignment received a score of 17 out of 20.

## Project Scope

The Car Dealership Website showcases the application of web programming principles, focusing on:

- **MVC Architecture:** Structuring the application with a clear separation of concernsâ€”Models for data handling, Views for user interfaces, and Controllers for managing interactions.

- **Data Structure-First Approach:** Prioritizing the design and implementation of efficient data structures to optimize data storage, retrieval, and manipulation within the website.

- **User Authentication with Identity:** Implementing secure and user-friendly authentication using ASP.NET Core Identity.

- **.NET Framework:** Leveraging the robust .NET framework to facilitate development, improve productivity, and ensure a scalable and maintainable codebase.

## Project Features

### 1. MVC Architecture

- **Models:** Handle data representation and manipulation, ensuring the integrity and reliability of information related to car listings, user accounts, and transactions.

- **Views:** Present a user-friendly interface for browsing car inventory, exploring details, and facilitating user interactions with the dealership.

- **Controllers:** Manage the flow of data between models and views, handling user requests, updating the database, and ensuring a seamless user experience.

### 2. Data Structure-First Approach

- **Efficient Database Design:** Implement data structures that facilitate efficient storage and retrieval of information related to cars, users, and transactions.

- **Optimized Search and Filtering:** Utilize appropriate data structures to enhance search and filtering functionalities, allowing users to find specific car models or browse based on preferences.

### 3. User Authentication with Identity

- **Secure User Registration and Login:** Leverage ASP.NET Core Identity for secure user registration, login, and password management.

- **Role-Based Authorization:** Implement role-based authorization to control access to specific features based on user roles.

### 4. .NET Framework Integration

- **ASP.NET Core:** Leverage the benefits of ASP.NET Core for building scalable and high-performance web applications.

- **Entity Framework:** Utilize Entity Framework for simplified data access, providing an abstraction over the database and promoting a code-first approach to database design.

## Future Enhancements

- **Responsive Design:** Optimize the website for a responsive design, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices.

- **Integration with External APIs:** Connect the website to external APIs for real-time car information, pricing, or additional features.
